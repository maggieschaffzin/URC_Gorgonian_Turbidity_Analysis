# Turbid Tides and Coral Hideaways: Factors Influencing Gorgonian Distribution and Density at Artificial and Natural Reef Ecosystems in Los Angeles
# About this Project
This study focuses on Santa Monica Bay (SMB), adjacent to the largest urban area on the west coast, where significant terrestrial pollution from wastewater, stormwater, and riverine outfalls creates high turbidity conditions, limiting light availability. To investigate Gorgonian colonization patterns in SMB, annual dive survey data from 109 natural and artificial reefs from 2016 to 2023 were analyzed. Depth stratified sampling was conducted across four depth zones: Inner (~5m), Middle (~10m), Outer (~15m), and Deep (~20m). Band transects (30m x 2m) were used to quantify macroinvertebrate and macroalgae species, and uniform point contact (30m) was employed to determine benthic cover, substrate, and reef physical structure. The study revealed that mean Gorgonian density is significantly higher in ARs compared to natural reefs (NR) across SMB and at reefs with high substrate variability. These findings suggest that ARs may provide enhanced habitat conditions conducive to Gorgonian growth and reproduction, underscoring the importance of considering artificial structures in managing temperate reef Gorgonian populations in the face of anthropogenic disturbance. 

# Where do the data come from? 
All datasets pertaining to Gorgonian density, habitat type, and habitat characteristics come from historical datasets from 2016-2023 from the Vantuna Research Group. Data may be available upon request.
Data for the stormwater, wastewater, and riverine outfall locations in Los Angeles come from the publicly available Los Angeles County Stormdrain System: https://pw.lacounty.gov/fcd/StormDrain/index.cfm

# In what order should things be run?
URC_Dataset_July_24.R > July_24_Analyses.R

# Who should I contact for data/questions?
